    "## Introduction  \n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project is to develop a **text classification model** that categorizes **consumer complaints** into five financial categories using **transformer-based algorithms**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset, obtained from the **Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)**, contains **over 2 million consumer complaints** from **2011 to 2024**. Each complaint is a textual **narrative** describing a financial issue, and these complaints have been labeled into **five main categories**:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Loans**  \n",
    "- **Credit Reporting**  \n",
    "- **Bank Accounts & Services**  \n",
    "- **Debt Collection**  \n",
    "- **Credit Card Services**  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Understanding  \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset originates from the **Consumer Complaint Database** maintained by the **Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)**, a **U.S. federal agency** that mediates disputes between financial institutions and consumers. Consumers submit complaints through an **online form**, detailing their financial issues.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset was **downloaded from the CFPB website** and underwent **preprocessing** to prepare it for NLP tasks. The key modifications include:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Retaining only records where a **\"Consumer complaint narrative\"** is available.  \n",
    "- Reducing the dataset from **5,842,373** records to **2,023,066** entries.  \n",
    "- Renaming the **\"Consumer complaint narrative\"** column to **\"narrative\"** for ease of coding.  \n",
    "- Consolidating **18 original product categories** into **5 main categories (product_5)** to address overlaps in classification.  \n",
