    "## Introduction  \n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project is to develop a **text classification model** that categorizes **consumer complaints** into five financial categories using **transformer-based algorithms**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset, obtained from the **Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)**, contains **over 2 million consumer complaints** from **2011 to 2024**. Each complaint is a textual **narrative** describing a financial issue, and these complaints have been labeled into **five main categories**:  \n",

    "\n",
    "The dataset originates from the **Consumer Complaint Database** maintained by the **Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)**, a **U.S. federal agency** that mediates disputes between financial institutions and consumers. Consumers submit complaints through an **online form**, detailing their financial issues.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset was **downloaded from the CFPB website** and underwent **preprocessing** to prepare it for NLP tasks. The key modifications include:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Retaining only records where a **\"Consumer complaint narrative\"** is available.  \n",
    "- Reducing the dataset from **5,842,373** records to **2,023,066** entries.  \n",
    "- Renaming the **\"Consumer complaint narrative\"** column to **\"narrative\"** for ease of coding.  \n",
    "- Consolidating **18 original product categories** into **5 main categories (product_5)** to address overlaps in classification.  \n",

Methods Used : Please describe the specific methods and procedures used to verify the disputed information. \nXXXX. Sources Consulted : Provide a list of all sources, including creditors or data furnishers, consulted during the investigation. \nXXXX. Documentation Reviewed : Detail any documentation or evidence reviewed to support the verification of the disputed information. \nXXXX. Verification Process : Explain how the accuracy of the information was verified and the criteria used for validation. \nXXXX. Timeline of Investigation : Outline the timeline of the investigation, including key dates and actions taken. \nViolations of Law : I believe the verification process by XXXX may violate my rights under the following laws : XXXX. 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ) : Compliance procedures to ensure maximum possible accuracy of consumer reports. \nXXXX. 15 U.S.C. 1681i : Procedure in case of disputed accuracy. \nXXXX. 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ( a ) ( 1 ) : Responsibility of furnishers of information to provide accurate information. \nXXXX. 12 CFR 1022.42 : General requirements for reasonable investigation of disputes. \nXXXX. 15 U.S.C. 1681c ( a ) ( 5 ) : Prohibition of adverse information older than seven years.\n\nI request the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) facilitate a thorough reinvestigation of the disputed information in my CoreLogic, XXXX, and XXXX report.
